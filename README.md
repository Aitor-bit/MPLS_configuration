# MPLS_configuration

This is a repo for showing some useful commands for MPLS configuration using the Linux kernel modules.

To run the environments, here are some steps to follow:

- In the host_config.sh you can find the commands that you need to execute before you can raise the environments, each with a brief explanation.

- After completing all the commands, you should navigate to one of the environment's folder: small, mid or big.

- Last step is to execute the ```docker-compose up``` command and your environment should be ready!
